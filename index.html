                    Steve Jobs, technology visionary who is best known as the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Apple Inc, was born on February 24, 1955.

                    Following high school graduation in 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Reed was an expensive college which Paul and Clara could ill afford. They were spending much of their life savings on their son's higher education. Jobs dropped
                    out of college after six months and spent the next 18 months dropping in on creative classes, including a course on calligraphy. He continued auditing classes at Reed while sleeping on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returning Coke
                    bottles for food money, and getting weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple.

                    In 1976, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer. Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, an electronics industry worker, founded Apple computer in the garage of Jobs's parents in order to sell it. They received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product-marketing
                    manager and engineer Mike Markkula.

                    Through Apple, Jobs was widely recognized as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer revolution and for his influential career in the computer and consumer electronics fields. Jobs also co-founded and served as chief executive of Pixar Animation
                    Studios; he became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, when Disney acquired Pixar.

                <p>
                    Jobs died at his California home around 3 p.m. on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated pancreatic cancer.

                            <p>Dear Sirs, This is probably the first time I get in contact with a company to send my condolences for the death of a person I never met. I just want to say how much I admire Steve Jobs' work. The products Mr. Jobs and Apple
                                have developed over the past years have changed the world. The way we listen to music, how we communicate, what products we use to create art and many other things will keep Mr. Jobs' fingerprint for many years. </p>
